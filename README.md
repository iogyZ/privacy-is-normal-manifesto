**Importance of Translation for User Adoption:**
Translating the manifesto into multiple languages is crucial for user adoption as it allows more people to access and understand the core principles and values behind the Zcash project. By sharing the manifesto on social media platforms in different languages, we can reach a wider audience and promote the importance of privacy as a fundamental right.

**Key Points from the Manifesto:**
1. Privacy as a Fundamental Right - The manifesto reaffirms that privacy is a fundamental human right that must be protected and preserved. It highlights the importance of privacy not only for individual freedom, but also for people's safety and dignity.
2. Technological Neutrality - The manifesto defends technological neutrality, stating that privacy should not be restricted to a privileged few, but rather standard and accessible to all technology users.
3. Individual Empowerment - By empowering users with tools and technologies that protect their privacy, the manifesto aims to empower individuals to control and protect their personal information.
4. Innovation and Progress - The manifesto highlights that innovation and technological progress should not be incompatible with privacy. On the contrary, they must be driven by it, encouraging the development of solutions that promote user privacy and security.
5. Transparency and Accountability - While defending privacy as a fundamental right, the manifesto confirms the importance of transparency and accountability in the implementation of privacy technologies. It highlights the need to balance legitimate privacy interests with other considerations, such as security and preventing illicit activities.

Let's work together to spread the message that "Privacy is Normal" in all languages and empower individuals to protect their personal information.
